<h1>About Us</h1>
<div class="otter">
<p>Our company's main goal is to help protect marine life and clear the ocean of our pollution.
We want creatures like these to live a happy life.
</p>
At Shark Attack, we are passionate about protecting marine life and safeguarding the world’s oceans through 
grassroots action. Founded on the belief that lasting change happens when communities unite, our organization is 
rooted in volunteer work, empowering individuals to become active stewards of the sea. From restoring coral reefs 
and organizing beach clean-ups to raising awareness about endangered species, we offer hands-on opportunities for 
people of all backgrounds to contribute meaningfully.
<br>
We are more than just an environmental group—we are a movement of changemakers dedicated to preserving the delicate 
balance of marine ecosystems. Our volunteers are the heart of everything we do, playing a vital role in cleaning coastlines, 
reducing pollution, and promoting sustainable living within their communities.
</br>
<br>
At Shark Attack, we invite you to join us on this journey. Whether you have a few hours to spare or are looking for long-term 
involvement, there is always a way to dive in and make a difference. Together, we can create a cleaner, healthier ocean and a 
brighter future for all marine life.
